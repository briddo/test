Toots follow up questions.

(a) What would you do to improve your submission in general?
(b) How would your code perform with millions of toots? What would you do
to improve it?
(c) Assuming you’ve done that, how would your code perform with deeply
nested toot threads? What would you do to improve it?
(d) Assuming you’ve done the above, how would your code perform with
thousands of requests per second? What would you do to improve it?
(e) How would you change your code to handle toots changing between requests?
(f) Suppose we added tags for toots. How would you implement an endpoint which
filtered both by author and tag simultaneously? Assume that there are more
authors than tags.
